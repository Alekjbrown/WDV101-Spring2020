        <h3>Polyphenols</h3>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Polyphenals</em></strong> are naturally occuring antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, tea, chocolates, and wine. They have been linked to reduced inflamation, lowering blood pressure, improved blood sugar levels and lower blood pressure. Pure sources of cocoa are one of the riches sources of polyphenols.

        <h3>Flavanols</h3>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Cocoa</em></strong> contains flavanols, which have been linked to some anti-diabetic effects. Consuming too much is certainly not good for blood sugar control, but smaller amounts can slow down carbohydrate digestion and improve insulin secretion. Dark chocolate contains less sugars and undergoes less processing, thus it contains more flavanols.

        <h3>Theobromine and Theophylline</h3>
