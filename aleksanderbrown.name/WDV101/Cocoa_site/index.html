            <strong>Cocoa</strong> is the basis of what we know as chocolate. The cacao tree is native to the Amazon basin and was domesticated in Mexico and Central America more than 4000 years ago. Evidence of its original wild range is obscured by the cultivation of the tree prior to Spanish arrival.

            Data suggests the tree was first domesticated in South America before migrating to Central America nearly 1500 years later. Artifacts found in Ecuador indicate the Mayo-Chinchipe people were cultivating it for religious ceremonies as long as 5300 years ago. Chemical analasys of pottery indicates that cocoa products were first consumed between 1500 and 1400BC in Honduras. It has also been indicated it was widely used as a currency prior to the Spanish conquest.

            Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. According to soldiers in the Spanish conquest of Mexico, <em>Moctezuma II</em> only drank chocolate and only from a golden goblet. The cocoa would be whipped into a froth and flavored with spices and vanilla before being consumed. Reportedly 2000 portions of cocao were consumed each day by nobles of the court, 60 of them being by <em>Moctezuma II</em> alone.

            In the mid-17th century, Chocolate was introduced to Europe by the Spanish and became a very populare drink.The drink was so popular, the Cacao tree was brought to the West Indies and Philippines. The Europeans also introduced it to Asia and into West Africa. The Gold coast was introduced to the Cacao by a Ghanian named <em>Tetteh Quarshie</em>, and became an important part of its future.
