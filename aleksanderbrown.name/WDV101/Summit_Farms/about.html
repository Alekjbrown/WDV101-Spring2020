        <p>
            The Alaskan Husky is a sled dog bred for working ability, not looks or pedigree, and there's no set formula for creating him. He is usually bred from various spitz-type dogs and has their characteristic prick ears, but in all other respects his looks vary widely.

            The Alaskan Malamute is perhaps the oldest and definitely the largest of the Arctic sled dogs. The breed is named after the Mahlemut, an Inuit tribe from Alaska's Kotzebue Sound area. The Alaskan Malamute is a big, powerful dog who was bred to pull sleds in harsh terrain and brutal climates.
